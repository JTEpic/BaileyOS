goals:
system clock
keyboard move cursor
0xE0 on keyboard
system error interrupts (eg divide by 0)
higher bit color mode

From OSDEV
If your kernel is bigger (or is expected to grow bigger) than this,
you'll probably prefer to have the kernel above the 1MB barrier,
which means you need to activate A20 gate and switch to Unreal Mode to load the kernel
(with A20 alone, you cannot have more than 64K above 1MB).
Note that BIOS will still be unable to write to memory above 1MB,
so you need to read stuff in a buffer below 1MB and then perform a rep movsd to place the data where they ultimately should go.
or int 13 LBA extended mode in 32 bit protected mode?

Uses bios not uefi
handle_default_interrupt only EOI PIC2 if part of it
better drive number in boot loader
flat binary to only elf? unless bootloader must be
readd ORG 0 to boot

(1)
bash make.sh

(2)
make
make qemu

(3)
bash debug.sh
make clean

Cross Compiler:
https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler
    Put extracted tar.gz into $HOME/src to not interfere with system root files:
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/
    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/
https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc

Put Binutils and GCC source code into $HOME/src folder (github repo may not work), -j 8, -j$(nproc)

export PREFIX="$HOME/opt/cross"
i686-elf for 32bit or x86_64-elf for 64bit
export TARGET=
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"

For Binutils and GCC:
    make cross-compiler
    Delete $HOME/src folder

Verify:
    exports listed above
    $HOME/opt/cross/bin/$TARGET-gcc --version
    #$TARGET-gcc --version
